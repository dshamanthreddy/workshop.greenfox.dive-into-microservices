# Workshop

## FAQ & help

### How to run docker-compose to start MongoDB & ActiveMQ?

* Open a terminal and go into the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is
* Execute `docker-compose up`


### I don't have the database from the workshop :(

* Create the database `workshop` with MongoChef: File / Add Database -> `workshop`
* Import the collections (you can find them in this repository in the [database](database/) folder) by right-clicking on the database `workshop`
  * Import collections
  * Choose import format: JSON - mongo shell / 3T MongoChef / mongoexport
  * Click on the "plus" icon and add the collections (customers_import.json & customers_transform.json)
  * Click "next"
  * Click "next"
  * Click "Start Import"


### How to see the content of MongoDB

* Open the app **MongoChef**
* Create a new connection with the following data:
  * Host: `localhost`
    * Or `192.168.99.100` if you use Windows and `localhost` is not working
  * Port: 27017


### How to start a microservices

* Open a terminal and go into the directory of the microservice you want to start, for example `projects/microservice.customer.import`
* Execute `mvn spring-boot:run`


### How to access the ActiveMQ web interface?

* Open `http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp` in the browser and use the following data to login:
  * Username: `admin`
  * Password: `admin`
* There you find the generated queues

## Projects

### Microservice 0: Hello World

Project: [microservice.hello-world](projects/microservice.hello-world)


### Microservice 1: Import customers

Project: [microservice.customer.import](projects/microservice.customer.import)

* Read a XML file with customer data
* Transform the data
* Save the data into MongoDB
* Send a message to ActiveMQ


### Microservice 2: Transform customers

Project: [microservice.customer.transform](projects/microservice.customer.transform)

* Read a message from ActiveMQ
* Read the imported customer from MongoDB
* Split the customer-list into single transformed customers
* Save the transformed customers into MongoDB

#### Task: fax not null

* If the `fax` of a customer is `null`, it should be replaced with a String of your choice

**Solution**

* You have to edit the file [TransformRawCustomerHandler](projects/microservice.customer.transform/src/main/java/de/synoa/workshop/handler/TransformRawCustomerHandler.java)
* and add the following lines before `// Add the customer to the result`:

```
if (customer.get("fax") == null) {
    customer.append("fax", "ðŸ˜±");
}
```


### Microservice 3: Customer API

Project: [microservice.customer.api](projects/microservice.customer.api)

* Read the transformed customers from MongoDB
* Create a REST API

#### Task: Return a customer based on the customernumber

* Implement the API to return a customer based on it's customernumber as JSON
* You can open the API by calling http://localhost:8092/api/customer/HUNG
* Hint: The 2. microservice [microservice.customer.transform](projects/microservice.customer.transform) already contains a way to read documents from MongoDB

**Solution**

* Extend the route [RestRouteBuilder.java](projects/microservice.customer.api/src/main/java/de/synoa/workshop/routes/RestRouteBuilder.java) with the following content:

```
from("direct:customer")
    // Create the query
    .bean(ReadCustomerHandler.class)

    // Read the customer from MongoDB
    .to("mongodb:mongodbConfig?database={{mongodb.database}}&collection=customers_transformed&operation=findOneByQuery")
;
```

* Create a new handler in the package `de.synoa.workshop.handler` with the name `ReadCustomerHandler` with the following content:

```
package de.synoa.workshop.handler;

import org.apache.camel.Handler;
import org.apache.camel.Header;

import com.mongodb.BasicDBObject;

public class ReadCustomerHandler {

    @Handler
    public BasicDBObject handle(@Header(value = "id") String customernumber) {
        BasicDBObject query = new BasicDBObject("customernumber", customernumber);

        return query;
    }
}
```

# Software requirements

The following software is required in order to follow the projects of this workshop:

## General

* Download the [docker images (activemq.tar & mongo.tar) from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2mQ6hpDchcQLU5ud0pMZFhPTk0?usp=sharing)
* Use these OS specific helper tools to install software more easily:

### Windows

Install the package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) by using cmd or PowerShell.

### MacOS

Install the package manager [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) by using the Terminal.


## Java 8 (JDK)
  * Windows: `choco install jdk8`
  * MacOS: `brew update && brew cask install java`
  * Linux: [Download & install](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml)

Verify if Java is working by running `java -version` in the terminal. It should give you an output similar to this:

```
java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)
```

## Maven
  * Windows: `choco install maven`
  * MacOS: `brew update && brew install maven`
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install maven` (Ubuntu)

Verify if maven is working by running `mvn -version` in the terminal. It should give you an output similar to this:

```
